For some reason, over last Christmas break, I woke up in the middle of the night and wrote a
function on some paper to raise some base 'n' to some exponent 'm'.

It only took a couple of minutes to write it so I forgot about it for two months.

Anyways, I stumbled upon the function today (2/22/20 -- 1:14 am) and decided why not throw it together and commit it.
